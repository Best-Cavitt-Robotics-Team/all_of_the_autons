left auton {"lweft>.<} (first case, slot 5):
goes to 3 block middle, scores middle goal, gets three in loader, scores in long goal, pushes into control

right auton {rite._.} (third case, slot 4):
gets 3 from loader and pushes into control quickls

solo awp {swowo ayeuupee} (second case, slot 5):
3 loader, 3 long, 6 mid, 1 mid goal, 3 loader, rest long

HOW TO UPLOAD CODE:
make the code you want to upload case 0, and if code is after the first auton (left), comment out all previos auton code. also change the project.pros to the desire name (next to case number).
this should leave you with:
1. all previous auton code commented out
2. current code that you want
3. the name of the code (project.pros)
4. all future code uncommented (because it doesnt matter)

now upload the code and repeat for different slots
NOTE:
change case number back to its original if you are uploading a previous case
